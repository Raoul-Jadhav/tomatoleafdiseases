# Transfer Learning:
  <h3>What Is Transfer Learning ?</h3>
  <p>Training a CNN from scratch is possible for small projects, most applications require the training of very large CNN’s and this as you guessed, takes extremely huge amounts of processed data and computational power. And both of these are not found so easily these days.That’s where transfer learning comes into play. In transfer learning, we take the pre-trained weights of an already trained model(one that has been trained on millions of images belonging to 1000’s of classes, on several high power GPU’s for several days) and use these already learned features to predict new classes.</p>




 <h3>The model used for classification is InceptionV3
